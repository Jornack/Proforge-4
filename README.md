The Proforge 4 Tool Changer 3D printer draws inspiration from the E3D Tool Changer, Voron 3D printer, and VZ Bot 3D printer. It enables high-speed multi-material 3D printing and operates as an open-source machine utilizing Klipper firmware, BigtreeTech control boards, and LDO motors. Crafted with precision CNC'd components, linear rails, and Gates belts, it aims for top-notch quality.

With an ample build volume of 400x300x400mm (X, Y, and Z respectively), the Proforge 4 offers versatility. It can also be enclosed for printing ABS filament. Our custom-designed hotend ensures high flow and speed. Impressively, a 3D Benchy in ABS with good quality can be printed in just around 13 minutes at maximum speed.
